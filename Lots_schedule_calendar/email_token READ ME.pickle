If the emailing functions start giving weird responses & failing, go to email_setup.py

manually run through the function to hit the lines:
           flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
               CREDENTIALS_FILE, SCOPES)
           creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)

this will open a chrome window & ask you to login

login with the above email & password

Close the window

run the next lines of code:
		with open(PICKLE_PATH, 'wb') as token:
           pickle.dump(creds, token)
